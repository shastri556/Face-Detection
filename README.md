Built a face detection model to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

The system recognizes, identifies and classifies faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. 

Used publicly available WIDER FACE dataset which is a face detection benchmark dataset. 

Skills and Tools:
Computer Vision, CNN, Transfer Learning, Object detection
